4. On the User page, enter information for this user

**Note:** Make sure your username doesn't contain anything related to admin. **So don't use something like admin@mydomain.onmicrosoft.com.** As this will cause problems when deploying Windows Virtual Desktop. 

5. Make sure you add the Directory Role **Global Administrator** for this user.
